Create a complete web-based Block Blast style puzzle game named "SafiBuilds Block Puzzle" using modern JavaScript and React. Target: Replit Game Stack (React). Deliver a production-ready repository with instructions and one-click run on Replit. Requirements:

1) Project & tech
- Use React (functional components + hooks), Vite or Create React App structure, and plain JavaScript or TypeScript (prefer JS unless TS requested).
- Mobile-first responsive layout, optimized for touchscreen (tap & drag).
- Build as a Progressive Web App (PWA): web app manifest, service worker, offline caching for assets, and installability.
- Provide a clean folder structure and package.json scripts: start, build, preview.

2) Gameplay
- Grid-based block puzzle mechanics similar to Block Blast (place and clear matching blocks, combos, increasing difficulty).
- Smooth touch and mouse controls (drag, swipe, tap-to-place).
- Animations for placing, matching, clearing and score popups (use CSS transitions/GSAP if needed).
- Level progression and difficulty curve.
- Score, level, and timer (if applicable).
- Local high-score saved in localStorage.

3) Online & Auth
- Optional Firebase integration for:
  • Online leaderboards (Firestore)
  • Anonymous guest play + Google Sign-In option
  • Save user high scores
- Include a toggle to enable/disable Firebase (so it runs without configuration).
- Provide instructions and sample Firebase config placeholders.

4) UI/UX & Branding
- App name "SafiBuilds Block Puzzle" visible in app header and PWA manifest.
- Modern colorful UI, easy-to-read fonts, big touch targets.
- Screens: Home, Play, Leaderboard, Settings, About.
- Game over modal with Play Again, Share Score (web share API), and Save to Leaderboard.
- Light and dark theme toggle.

5) Monetization & Publishing readiness
- For web: include a placeholder area for ads (describe how to add Google AdSense or other web ad networks).
- Include instructions for converting the PWA to an Android APK using:
  • Bubblewrap (Trusted Web Activity) or
  • Capacitor (Ionic) — include example commands and manifest changes.
- Create adaptive icons and a basic icon pack (512x512, 192x192, etc.) for Play Store and manifest.

6) Accessibility & Performance
- Responsive to common screen sizes (320px–1440px).
- Lighthouse-friendly (performance, accessibility, best practices).
- Lazy load assets and optimize bundle size.

7) Code quality & deliverables
- Well-structured, commented, and production-ready code.
- Provide README.md with:
  • How to run locally on Replit
  • How to configure Firebase (create project, add config)
  • How to build PWA and test installability
  • How to wrap to Android (bubblewrap/capacitor step-by-step; commands)
  • How to prepare Play Store listing assets (icons, screenshots) and sign APK
- Provide sample .env.example and clear steps to replace placeholder keys.
- Provide screenshots (or generate mockups) and suggested Play Store description, short description, and 10 keywords.

8) Output format
- Deliver complete repo/folder structure in Replit with all files so I can run and export.
- Add a "publish-ready" folder that includes required Play Store assets and a short packaging checklist.

Notes:
- If any 3rd-party packages require API keys, leave placeholder keys and document how to add them.
- Keep default package name / web manifest name as "com.safibuilds.blockblast.web" or similar.
- Prioritize mobile touch UX and offline-friendly play.

Finish by running tests (if any) and provide final instructions to:
1) run on Replit,
2) test PWA install on Android,
3) convert to APK via Bubblewrap/Capacitor, and
4) publish to Play Store (step-by-step checklist).
